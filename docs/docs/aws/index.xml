If you use an Alias record that points to an AWS resource, you can only use it with a single AWS resource.</description></item><item><title>VPC</title><link>https://haani-niyaz.github.io/devops-journal/docs/aws/vpc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://haani-niyaz.github.io/devops-journal/docs/aws/vpc/</guid><description>VPC FAQ # VPC # What is the relationship between route tables and subnets? # Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table, which controls the routing for the subnet (subnet route table).
A route table can be associated with multiple subnets. However, a subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time. Any subnet not explicitly associated with a table is implicitly associated with the main route table by default.</description></item></channel></rss>
