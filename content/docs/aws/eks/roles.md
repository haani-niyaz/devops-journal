### How to map a user to a group in Kubernetes?

See my explanation [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-iam-authenticator/issues/139#issuecomment-667644772). Also see the oficial documentation which illustrates this at a very high level [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-auth.html) and the more technical details on how to configure `aws-auth` ConfigMap can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/add-user-role.html).
